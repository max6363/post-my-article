## Architecture

The application is developed using the VIPER architecture, promoting clear separation of concerns and scalability:

- **View**: Manages UI and user interactions.
- **Interactor**: Handles business logic and data operations.
- **Presenter**: Acts as a mediator between View and Interactor.
- **Entity**: Defines data models.
- **Router**: Handles navigation and screen transitions.

VIPER ensures that the app adheres to SOLID principles, fostering a modular and easily testable codebase.
